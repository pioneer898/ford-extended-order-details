Extension for showing extra details about Ford order status


The [Ford order tracking site](https://www.ford.com/myaccount/vehicle-order-tracking) doesn't show all the order details that are actually retuned, this extension simply collects that information and displays it on the page.

To use simply visit the Ford tracking site and enter your tracking details. You should see the "Extended Details" section. 

Note that this information may have been intentionally obscured by the Ford tracker, so it may not be fully trustworthy, so take it at face value.
